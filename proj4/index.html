    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, we implemented a basic cloth simulater with a lot of very cool features, starting with a spring and mass system. In part 1, we build a grid of masses and springs which acted as the basis of our cloth for the future parts of the simulation and populated the cloth's point_masses and spring vectors. We then implemented the motion of the cloth in part 2 using physics equations that tracked the positions of the cloth as it fell. We then implemented parts of the model to handle collisions between the cloth and the sphere, and self collisions for the cloth. Finally, we implemented various shaders to simulate the light and textures of the scene. These shaders included diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, displacement mapping, bump mapping, and environment-mapped reflections.</p>

      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Changing the spring constant affects the stiffness of the springs connecting the cloth points. As you can see in the photos below, having a low ks causes the cloth to be more easily foldable, and smoother like silk, whereas a higher ks value makes the cloth more like construction paper where it is much stiffer with less natural wrinkles.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      For density, we would be chaning mass distributions (as per the definition of density). THe lower the density, the lighter the cloth would be as evident in the photos below that the lower density has the cloth hanging less from its points, where the higher density is pulling the cloth much more downwards from the points. The cloth will move much easier with a lower density.

    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Damping affects the rate that the cloth loses/gains energy due to friction etc. The lower the damping value, the less energy lost, so it takes a long time to come to rest. I put the damping level to the minimum, and the cloth kept oscillating after being dropped without stopping. Negates the force of gravity and other forces. With a high damping value, there was no oscillation and the cloth simply quickly fell and stopped i.e lost all its energy immediately.

    <p>
      Photo 1: Low KS, this is so interesting to me because with a minimum ks we can see the cloth is so easily malleable from the wrinkles already present when its fully dropped, much less malleable than the default parameters. Everything was kept the same here but the ks value which was dropped to the minimum. When we have ks=1, it takes a long time to come to rest. This is because it is so un-stuff on the points of the cloth that the energy from the cloth falling keeps permeating. Photo 2: Low damping. I mentioned earlier why this is so cool, but in the photo here I was only able to capture it oscillating, the movement never stopped, which is different than the default since that cloth comes to rest. The parameters I changed were to keep everything at default except for the damping, which I set to the absolute minimum value.

      <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      As seen in the photos above, we altered the spring constant of the cloth before dropping it on the sphere and see some expected results. For the case where the spring constant is lowest, we expect the cloth to be less stuff and malleable, like dropping silk onto the sphere, which this photo perfectly resembles, there is barely any stiffess and the cloth smoothly falls over. As we increase ks, however, the stiffness increases. The middle photo has slightly less malleability and we are slightly retaining that planar shape of the cloth. In the last case, we are really trying to maintain the shape and it looks similar to a very stiff cloth trying to cover a sphere.

    <p>
      Here you will find lots of different combinations of ks and density, the organization is a little haphazard so let me guide you through our findings. We know from earlier that changing ks changes the cloths stiffness, and changing the density changes the ease of movement since the cloth is heavier. We see this in all the cases where density is 1. In both of those cases you see the description is that the cloth fell slowly and smoothly, meaning a lighter cloth. In either of these, the ks was 1000 as you can see how crumpled it is, and in another the ks is 5000, where you can see the cloth maintains its structure well looking a lot like construction paper. Now, when we keep density high 1000, the ks is outweighted and the cloth gets really destroyed on itself, i.e it cannot hold its structure and keep its stiffness due to the high density of the cloth. When we have the case where ks=5000 and density is 50, we see more of a balance where the cloth falls slower but is able to maintain its structure a little better before crumpling, due to the high ks and lower density.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is designed to make shadows, lighting, reflections etc. in order to make the virtual world look as realistic as possible. Vertex and fragment shaders are two types of shader programs that try to achieve this. Vertex shaders work on creating effects based on the vertices of a 3d object in virtual space and shows how light etc refracts/reflects off the surface. The fragment shader then takes that and finds the colors to be put on the screen by averaging the neighboring vertices to create a smooth and realistic look.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a lighting computer graphics model that simulates realistic instances of lighting for 3D renderings. In order to shade our image using Blinn-Phong, we take into account ambient light, diffuse light, and specular reflection. The Blinn-Phong implementation takes in the light intensity and position, and shades our image based on the following equation with the 3 lighting components: L = K_a * I_a + K_d * (I / r^2) * max(0, n⋅l) + k_s * (I / r^2) * max(0, n⋅h)^p.

    <p>
      Bump mapping works by altering surface normals so that our shader gives our image details. We calculate these normals by creating a tangent-bitangent-normal (TBN) matrix, which we can use, along with calculate dU and dV values and a height map of surface features, to find our altered surface normal. Displacement mapping, however, we modify positions of verticies in the mesh. This allows for more detail and realistic results. We modified our positions by the equation p' = p + n * h(u, v) * k_h. As we can see in our images, the level of detail in our bump and displacement mapping change base on our height and normal values. At a high higher, the geometry change in the displacement map gets more noticable and jagged. Additionally, both bump mapping and displacement mapping attempt to give our images texture, which they both do with reatively retalistic detail. Because displacement mapping changes the positions in our mesh, the geometry of shapes in the image actually also get changed. As a result, our cloth and sphere get slightly deformed in shape, where as the objects in bump mapping only change on the surface. We also changed the image's coarseness between 16 and 128. The bump mapping render seems to look better for the smaller coarseness value of 16, as the large bumps for the displacement mapping images for a higher coarseness seem to noticably alter the shape and the texture of the objects that make it harder to distinguish. Additionally, renders for the 128 coarseness seem to have larger bumps from the larger coarseness values, and as a result have more "harsh" textures for the brick appearances of our images.
